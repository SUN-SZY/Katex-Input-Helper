# Katex Input Helper Joplin Plugin

This plugin can be used to support the input of Mathematical formulae. It does this by opening an input dialog by command, then generating the formula and finally returning the edited formula back to the original note.

For improved documentation see the following [Wiki](/Mick2nd/Katex-Input-Helper/wiki).

## Basic Instructions

1. Open a note with a formula area, select a piece of the formula to be processed.
2. Invoke the Katex Input Helper dialog with a keyboard shortcut.
3. Process the formula in the upper part of the dialog in Katex format.
4. Get feedback in the lower part of the dialog where the generated formula is displayed.
5. Finally leave the dialog either by pressing the **Okay** or the **Cancel** button.
6. By pressing Okay the changed content is returned to the note and replaces the original selection.
7. By pressing Cancel nothing is changed.

## Step - by - Step Instructions

1. Enter the *Katex Input Helper* with a certain selection of a formula. With no selection in the current note the editor will be opened empty.
1. Insertion of formulae from the palette window(s)
   1. Open the palette with the desired template, f.i. an integral
   2. Click the template to insert it into the editor window
   3. Fill in the missing pieces of the formula
   4. This filling can be recursive, e.g. require another click on a different template
   5. The same can be done with the usage of other auxiliary windows, f.i. horizontal or vertical spacing, matrices or sample equations
   6. Many of them don't use placeholders as the "templates" often do
5. Returning a processed formula
   1. Simply leave the dialog with *Okay* and the content of the editor area will be returned back to the Joplin note and replaces the original selection.
   2. Pressing *Cancel* leaves the original note as it was before invocation of the dialog
3. Loading and saving the editor area
   This can be done by invoking the menu commands *File - Open* or *File - Save* respectively
4. Working with the *Custom Equations* dialog.
   One can invoke this dialog by clicking *Insert - Custom Equations*.
   It is possible to perform the following tasks:
   1. Save the set of formulae into a json file
   2. Load a set of formulae from a json file
   3. Add a formula from the editor area
   4. Remove checked formulae from the datagrid
   5. Click a formula to insert it into the editor area
   6. Edit the *Title* field of a formula by double - clicking it
   7. Filter the set of formulae by a filter expression. Actually this checks if the filter expression is contained in the title field
   8. Sort the formulae by title
   9. Select pages of a huge formula set
   10. Edit the new *Categories* tree on the left side. Categories are divided into folders and leafs. Only the leafs can contain formulae.
   11. By selecting a Leaf one can select the formulae contained in it.
   12. One can sort existing formulae into different Leafs.
   13. The old style formula collection is not lost. Such formulae are sorted into a *Default* leaf node.
1. Retaining window positions and sizes.
   By default the window positions and sizes are retained leaving them intact through invocations of the window itself or the whole Katex Input Helper.
   This feature can be deactivated by deselecting the appropriate checkbox in the Settings dialog (Menu command *Options - Editor Parameters...*).
   These *Hidden settings* can be reset on behalf of the *Settings* dialog.

## Origin of the Software

The plugin is based on the *Visual Math Editor* by David Grima, a freeware which can be changed and distributed freely. I made the following changes to this software:

1. Reverse engineering
2. Updated the included software libraries to current ones.
3. Replaced the MathJax package by a Katex package.
4. Removed some components of the software not needed for this purpose, like:
   1. AsciiMath support
   2. Translation of the Katex expression into MathML
   3. A HTML mode to support html input
   4. Some dialogs and menu items
   5. Some MathJax expressions are not supported in Katex and removed for this reason
5. But most components are left as is and the external appearance is preserved

As You can see, this software is feature rich and alleviates the creation of formulae. My hope is one will get further support by the integration into *Joplin* as a plugin.

This software is available on the net [here](https://visualmatheditor.equatheque.net/VisualMathEditor.html?runLocal&codeType=Latex&encloseAllFormula=false&style=aguas&localType=en_US) and You can view at it to get an impression.

## Features

1. Editing in a text editor like the one in Joplin
2. Feedback in the formula output area
3. 16 palettes with formula templates like Sum and Product, Integral and much more
4. Formula dialogs with samples with can be incorporated easily or studied for learning the Katex language
5. A **custom equations** dialog which can be used to maintain one's own formula library and with the possibility to Add, Remove, Load, Save the formula set. This set is persisted through invocations of Joplin as hidden setting.
6. Window positions and sizes are persisted

## Special Features of the Mobile Version

1. The user interface is somewhat different, but functionality is the same
1. The Latex input area and the Formula output area are reversed for a better experience with mobile screen keyboards
1. Navigation panels are used and dialogs, the side panels and the menus are moved out from the main screen to such panels
1. Implemented swipe gestures to simplify navigation between panels: they are always processed on the title bars only
   1. Use swipe left and swipe right on the main panel to navigate to the appropriate side panels
   1. Use swipe left or swipe right to navigate back to the main panel
   1. Use swipe down to dismiss the side menu or the dialog wrapper panels

## Known Problems

- A minor problem is a missing update of the language of the data grid paging bar in the *Custom Equations* dialog. This only appears during language change during an actual activation of the dialog.
- The persistence of custom equations can be damaged when a filter is active. 
- The *web* version of this app does work bad on *Firefox* and on mobile devices in that many dialogs are sized wrong. 
This does not appear on the *Chrome* browser on desktop.
- The mobile version does regularly pop-up the screen keyboard. No mechanism is known to avoid this.
